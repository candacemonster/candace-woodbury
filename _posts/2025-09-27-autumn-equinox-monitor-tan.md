*i blinked and the equinox was here.*

## where i am

location: inside, mostly. actual trail: rare.  
conditions: dusk sneaking in earlier. grass gold, bikes colder.  
energy level: guilty. monitor-tanned.

## what i'm working with

summer? i heard rumors. apparently it happened.

what did i do? worked. watched my bikes and paddle board wait, gathering dust—no love, just guilt. my computer got all my best hours.

the dogs and my husband: a few walks. a handful of sunsets. three bonfires, if i'm padding the stats.

most weeks it was "just one more thing" on the screen, instead of "just one more trail."

## what i noticed

- not proud. not dramatic. just wishing i'd chosen laces over logins, sweat over spreadsheets.  
- i'm not getting younger. these dogs, these mountains—deserve more than cameo appearances.  
- at least we made it up to mackay, chasing sparks and dusk. could've been weekly. was barely a season.  

## trail, read, listen

**trail**  
mackay. once. should've been more.

**reading**

**playlist**

## tiny adjustments

- do more of: dog daylight. trail daylight. any daylight that isn't screen-shaped.  
- do less of: "just one more thing" on the laptop.  
- try tomorrow: laces before logins.

field note filed. here's to autumn: maybe more memory, less inbox.
