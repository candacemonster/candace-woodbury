*sometimes the last hike looks like an ordinary morning.*

## where i am

location: high point trail, red cliffs desert reserve, st. george, utah  
conditions: off cottonwood springs rd / old dump rd (black gulch trailhead)  
energy level: heavy. sore hearts.

## what i'm working with

we'd checked out a few trails the morning of october 25th. nothing urgent, just wandering, letting the girls stretch their legs—meant to be a quick scope at the trailhead, you know, just see what's what. maybe come back for a longer hike or bike ride when joints and attitudes felt up for it.

old age and spinal arthritis had other plans. slapped us in the face, hard and fast, a few days later. plans for "next time" evaporated. and suddenly we were left saying goodbye, forever, to our baby and trail partner tove.

desert light has felt a bit different after that.

## what i noticed

highlights (aka distractions for sore hearts):

- yellow flashes — desert marigold, probably, stubborn and loud  
- long, dancing grasses — demanding photographic attention  
- purple asters — little disco accents pushing through rosette leaves  
- orange globemallow — easy to spot, easier to admire  
- low, white desert spurge — sticking close to rocks, probably smarter than all of us

## terrain notes

sandy, rocky, flat-ish. not much elevation gain, but every bump counts when the pack gets older. dog approval ratings fine for our gals, except for the holes (existential and otherwise).

## for fellow wanderers

- bring water. stay humble. desert trails don't care about your backstory.  
- if you're here with old dogs, take extra photos.  
- leave no trace but maybe a few quiet memories.
