*everything's ready. still haven't gone.*

## where i am

location: reservoir edge, parked with a water view and no real excuse.  
conditions: still. warm. strangers present but minding their business.  
energy level: stalled. that familiar static.

## what i'm working with

- board: inflated  
- gear: packed  
- water: calm  
- day: open  

not scared. just stuck on the part where i walk past a few people, alone. then be out there, still alone. even if i like it.

if there were a dock, i'd already be gone.  
if someone said "let's go," i would've.

## what i noticed

- bought [onx backcountry](https://share-backcountry.onxmaps.com/exwods8oaVb). not for the trails (though it does those), but for property lines. water access. land boundaries.  
- also: to track paddles. to feel like i'm collecting something useful—or at least map-shaped.

## trail, read, listen

**trail**  
none today. stayed parked.

## tiny adjustments

- do more of: just going, even without the dock or the invite.  
- do less of: writing about it instead of doing it.  
- try tomorrow: maybe tomorrow.

field note filed. wrote this instead of paddling. at least it's honest.
