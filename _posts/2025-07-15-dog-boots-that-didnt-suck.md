*finally. boots that stayed on.*

## where i am

location: trail, post-hike debrief.  
conditions: hot enough to matter.  
energy level: satisfied. dogs tired. boots still on.

## what i'm working with

the problem: hot pavement, sharp rocks, one dog who loses boots like it's her job.

tried a lot of boots. most ended up in the trail dust within the first quarter mile.

## what actually worked

**[Dog Mocs](https://www.dogmocs.com/)**  
- stayed on (the bar is low, but still)  
- decent grip  
- not stiff  
- held up on rocks and heat  

not perfect. nothing is. but these didn't end up as expensive trail litter.

## what i noticed

- the strap system actually matters more than the boot itself  
- sizing is accurate—measure twice  
- they still looks at me like i've betrayed them when i put them on  

## tiny adjustments

- do more of: just putting them on even when I get the look.  
- do less of: buying boots based on cute colors.  
- try next: maybe socks underneath for the drama queen paws.
