things i make when i should probably be resting instead.


## candidnook
[bookshop.org/shop/candidnook](https://bookshop.org/shop/candidnook)  
shop my stacks to quietly fund indie bookstores and my reading habit. honestly, a pretty gentle vice.


## making things
[shecodes](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/54828-candace-woodbury)  
small projects, gentle chaos, and the occasional intentional broken layout.

[side quests](/pages/side-quests)  
stray ideas, micro-tools, and “this might be overkill” experiments.  

[side quests with ai](/pages/side-quests-ai)  
where i let the bots assist, then ship only what survives.


## studio drift (coming)
slow-building space for future work. not public yet, on purpose.

most things stay in drafts. these are the ones that wandered out anyway.
