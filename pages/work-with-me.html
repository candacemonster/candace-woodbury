      <p>I help people and small teams get clearer, calmer, and more confident in how they run things. My style is minimalist and intentional. I don't bring in tools you don’t need. I don’t run at a frantic pace. I ask good questions, and I help you get unstuck — then I step back so you can keep going.</p>
      <p>Most of the time, you already know what needs to change. You just need a sounding board, a second set of eyes, or someone to help you shape the way forward. That’s where I come in — for a bit, not forever.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who I Typically Help</h2>
      <p>I work best with small teams, founders, solo operators, creators, or non-profits who want to simplify and clarify their workflows without drama. If you prefer straight talk, calm processes, and honest feedback, you’ll probably find it’s a good fit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We’ll Work</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>We start with a conversation about where you are and what you need.</li>
        <li>We set a goal, schedule a session (or two), and I help you get unstuck.</li>
        <li>Light, direct support via email while you implement changes.</li>
        <li>Hand-off and next steps—no obligations, no follow-ups unless you want them.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Strategy &amp; Setup Sessions</h2>
