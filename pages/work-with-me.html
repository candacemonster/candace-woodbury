      <p>I help people and small teams get clearer, calmer, and more confident in how they run things. My style is minimalist and intentional. I don't bring in tools you don‚Äôt need. I don‚Äôt run at a frantic pace. I ask good questions, and I help you get unstuck ‚Äî then I step back so you can keep going.</p>

      <p>Most of the time, you already know what needs to change. You just need a sounding board, a second set of eyes, or someone to help you shape the way forward. That‚Äôs where I come in ‚Äî for a bit, not forever.</p>
