    <h1>Work With Me</h1>
    <p>I help people and small teams get clearer, calmer, and more confident in how they run things. My style is minimalist and intentional. I don't bring in tools you donâ€™t need. I donâ€™t run at a frantic pace. I ask good questions, and I help you get unstuck â€” then I step back so you can keep going.</p>

    <p>Most of the time, you already know what needs to change. You just need a sounding board, a second set of eyes, or someone to help you shape the way forward.</p>

    <h2>Mini-Engagements (2â€“4 Weeks)</h2>
    <p>One clear goal. A few short sessions. Then you move forward.</p>

    <p><strong>Includes:</strong><br>
    â€“ One discovery session<br>
    â€“ One guided session or screen share<br>
    â€“ One review or follow-up<br>
    â€“ Light support by email for a week</p>

    <p><strong>Investment:</strong> $1,250â€“$1,500<br>
    <strong>Good for:</strong> solo business owners, creators, and nonprofits in transition</p>

    <h2>Strategy & Setup Sessions</h2>
    <p>One 90-minute session focused on a specific problem, decision, or system. Then one week of asynchronous support while you apply it.</p>

    <p><strong>Investment:</strong> $475â€“$650<br>
    <strong>Good for:</strong> refining your client process, mapping a new offer, updating workflows, or clearing out whatâ€™s not working</p>

    <h2>Hourly Support</h2>
    <p>If you need help setting something up, fixing whatâ€™s not working, or walking through a system together â€” I also offer hourly sessions.</p>

    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> $150/hour<br>
    Billed in 30-minute increments, no minimums.</p>

    <p>This is best for light training, setup, audits, or one-off tasks where a full engagement isnâ€™t needed. Simple and straightforward.</p>

    <h2>Tech & Tools</h2>
    <p>I wonâ€™t push software. If you already have a system, Iâ€™ll help make it work better. If you donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll recommend a few that fit your needs. Then Iâ€™ll show you how to use what you choose â€” clearly, simply, and without overbuilding.</p>

    <h2>More About My Work</h2>
<p>This isnâ€™t everything â€” just what tends to come up. I donâ€™t list tools to impress. I list them so you donâ€™t have to explain what they are.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also continuing my coding education through <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/54828-candace-woodbury" target="_blank">SheCodes</a>. Always learning. Always tinkering.</p>

<p>I work with what you already have, and I donâ€™t make things more complicated than they need to be. More background on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candacewoodbury/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
    <p>I donâ€™t offer retainers or ongoing support. I donâ€™t do launch management or live inside your tools. I work in short sprints, with intention. If we need to reconnect later, weâ€™ll book another session.</p>

    <p><strong>Every project begins with a 20-minute intro call. No pitch. Just a conversation.</strong></p>

    <h2>Letâ€™s Talk</h2>
    <p>If youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or quietly ready to change something â€” Iâ€™d be glad to talk.</p>

    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:studio@candacewoodbury.com">studio@candacewoodbury.com</a><br>
    Location: Mountain West (available remote or with notice)</p>

    <p><strong>Ready to chat?</strong><br>
    You can book a free 20-minute intro call below â€” just a calm, no-pressure conversation to see if weâ€™re a fit.</p>

    <h2>Already Working With Me?</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re a returning client or mid-project, you can use your private booking link to schedule more time. If you need to update anything â€” scope, timing, or support â€” just email me directly.</p>

<p>All invoices are sent digitally and payable by card or ACH. If you need anything for your records (W9, contract copy, etc.), Iâ€™m happy to send it over.</p>
