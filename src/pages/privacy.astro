    <h1>privacy policy</h1>
    <p class="updated"><em>Last updated: March 10, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the digital mausoleum of my thoughts. This Privacy Policy explains—in all its legally necessary, yet dry glory—how I collect, process, and occasionally scrutinize your data. 
      By lingering on this site, you agree (silently, if not enthusiastically) to the terms below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Soon, I plan to implement Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to capture the ghostly echoes of your online wanderings. When in place, rest assured that only anonymized data will be used—no personal secrets, just statistics to help me understand the curious behavior of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, this site contains affiliate links (to Bookshop.org, Amazon, etc.). If you indulge in a little commerce via these links, I may receive a modest commission—think of it as a tip for tolerating the absurdities of modern digital life.
    </p>

    <h2>Newsletter Signups (Future Feature)</h2>
    <p>
      In the near future, I might launch a newsletter—a curated dispatch of musings, updates, and occasional irreverence. 
      Should you decide to subscribe, your email (and any extra tidbits you offer) will be used solely for sending these communications. 
      Rest assured, your details won’t be sold to third parties (unless the law decides otherwise).
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, cookies. Not the edible variety, but digital crumbs that track your usage and support affiliate marketing. 
      By browsing here, you consent to their use. If you’d prefer a cookie-free experience, be warned: it might not be as sweet.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      I utilize third-party services (such as Google Analytics and affiliate networks) for data collection and tracking. 
      Their privacy policies—while about as exciting as a tax form—apply to the data they collect. 
      For more details, please consult their respective policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your locale, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. 
      Should you wish to exercise any of these rights, drop an email to
      <a href="mailto:privacy@candacewoodbury.com">privacy@candacewoodbury.com</a>. 
      Fair warning: while I’ll address your request promptly, don’t expect overly warm or fuzzy responses.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time—because, like all things digital (and a few people’s hairlines), it must evolve. 
      The “Last updated” date will change accordingly, so check back periodically if you care enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, concerns, or simply want to discuss the absurdity of privacy in a digital age, email me at
      <a href="mailto:privacy@candacewoodbury.com">privacy@candacewoodbury.com</a>.
