    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 15, 2025</p>
  
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to this digital mausoleum of my thoughts. This Privacy Policy is here to inform you—in the driest terms possible—that I collect and use data, not out of nosiness but because someone has to keep track of the chaos. By remaining on this site, you silently agree to all the tedious details outlined below.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
    <p>
      I use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to capture the ghostly echoes of your online wanderings. Rest assured, no personal details are recorded—just anonymized numbers and percentages that help me understand the curious behavior of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      My site also features affiliate links to Bookshop.org and Amazon. Should you choose to indulge in commerce via these links, I may receive a modest commission—consider it a tip for enduring the absurdities of modern digital life.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, cookies. Not the edible kind, but digital crumbs that track your usage and support affiliate marketing. By browsing here, you consent to their presence. If you’d rather not, well, too bad—cookies are here whether you like them or not.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      I employ third-party services like Google Analytics for data collection and affiliate tracking. These services have their own privacy policies, which are as riveting as a tax form. Please refer to them if you need more details.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your locale, you might have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. For any such requests, direct your inquiries to <a href="mailto:privacy@candacewoodbury.com">privacy@candacewoodbury.com</a>—though don’t expect a warm, fuzzy response.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time—because even the most meticulously crafted policies must evolve. The "Last updated" date will reflect any changes, so check back periodically if you care.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, concerns, or just want to discuss the finer points of privacy in a world gone mad, email me at <a href="mailto:privacy@candacewoodbury.com">privacy@candacewoodbury.com</a>.
