<section class="welcome">
    <h1>welcome. or whatever.</h1>
	<p>I’m Candace, a homebody existing somewhere between “I’ve got this” and “what the hell is this.” Life didn’t go as planned, but I assume that’s true for most people, so I try not to take it personally.</p>
	<p>I read before I write—mostly because writing is hard and reading is easier. But I write anyway. I hike because I have dogs. They demand it, and frankly, so do I—otherwise, we’d all start biting people.</p>
	<p>This site exists because I made it. What will end up here? Unclear. Books, hikes, passing thoughts—things worth remembering, or at least things I don’t want to forget just yet. No themes, no schedules, no content strategy. Just words, arranged into sentences, when I feel like it.</p>
	<p>Stay, don’t stay. Browse, don’t browse. Either way, I’ll be here, drinking coffee, questioning my decisions, and silently critiquing bad typography.</p>
