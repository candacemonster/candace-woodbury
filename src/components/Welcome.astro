<section class="welcome">
    <h1>you’re here. how ascinating.</h1>
    <p>I read before I write, mostly because writing is hard and reading is better. But I write anyway. Poorly.</p>
    <p>I walk because I have dogs. They require it, and frankly, so do I—otherwise, we’d all start biting people.</p>
    <p>Stay, don’t stay. Browse, don’t browse. It’s all the same to me. I’ll be here, drinking coffee, judging font choices, and avoiding unnecessary human interaction.</p>
