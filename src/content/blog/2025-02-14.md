An obligatory first post, a mild existential crisis, and a firm rejection of the word 'blog.'

I have, on multiple occasions, attempted to blog. It has never gone well. Something about the word itself is grating—too casual, too eager, like an overenthusiastic waiter who squats at your table to take your order. I’ve also dabbled in Substack. Why? Unclear. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Now, I plan to take those posts down, file them under "well, that happened," and move on.

So, this is where words will live. About what? Still up for debate. But the site is simple. It works. No algorithms tracking every thought. No pressure to perform existence. Just words, arranged in a way that (hopefully) makes sense.

Maybe, if enough people care, there will be an actual newsletter—preferably one that exists outside the confines of an inbox. Handwritten letters used to be standard. Now, they’re practically an art form. Cursive, once a basic skill, has become a secret code. And mirror writing—something Da Vinci did, I believe, though that’s not to claim genius—has somehow become the default journaling method. Perhaps a mild distrust of digital permanence has something to do with it.

But for now, this exists. And that’s enough.

Welcome, I suppose.
