Hello world!

It’s one of those mornings where everything feels a bit off — not quite cold, not quite warm. A little like me when I try to get out of bed but am too comfortable to make it happen. I should’ve woken up earlier. The dogs knew it, I knew it, but the cozy bed just kept calling us back.

After far too many minutes spent in denial, coffee finally convinced me to get up. And now, here I am, pretending to be productive when all I really want to do is read and ignore my emails. You know the drill.

But that’s life. You think you’re going to be all motivated and organized, but really? You’re just trying to survive the day with a cup of coffee and some good books on the backburner.

So, here we are. This is me, writing about my attempts at being "productive" while simultaneously daydreaming about everything else. Enjoy.
