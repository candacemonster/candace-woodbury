# candacewoodbury.com

A minimalist website for someone with no interest in branding, optimizing, or monetizing their personality.

Built with plain HTML and CSS — not because it’s clever, but because it’s enough. No frameworks. No build tools. No bells. Especially no whistles.

### What This Is

A small, quiet corner of the internet.

There are no life hacks here, no productivity pyramids, no exhortations to *smash the button*. This exists because disappearing completely didn’t feel quite right.

It may include:

- The occasional note, posted irregularly  
- A list of projects that haven’t collapsed (yet)  
- Sentences I don’t entirely hate  

---

### What This Isn’t

- A blog (please)  
- A startup  
- A personal brand  
- A funnel, pipeline, or ecosystem

- Add new notes under `notes/` and link them from `index.html`  
- Update `notes.xml` and `sitemap.xml` manually when new content is added  
- No frameworks, no dependencies, no build process  
- Keep it human, readable, and quiet

Custom domain is managed via `CNAME`.  
No tracking, no analytics, no database, and no JavaScript required.  
Updates are manual and intentional.

### Metadata

- `description`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, etc.
