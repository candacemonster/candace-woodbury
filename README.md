# candacewoodbury.com

A minimalist website for someone with no interest in branding, optimizing, or monetizing their personality.

Built with plain HTML and CSS — not because it’s clever, but because it’s enough. No frameworks. No build tools. No bells. Especially no whistles.

### What This Is

A small, quiet corner of the internet.

There are no life hacks here. No productivity pyramids. No exhortations to *smash the button*. This exists because disappearing entirely didn’t feel quite right.

You might find:

- The occasional note, posted irregularly  
- A list of still-breathing side projects  
- Sentences I don’t entirely hate  

---

### What This Isn’t

- A blog (please)  
- A startup  
- A personal brand  
- A funnel, pipeline, or ecosystem

- `index.html`: Home  
- `pages/`: Static pages and notes  
- `styles.css`: Global styles (supports dark/light mode)  
- No JS except a single-line theme toggle  

---

### Maintenance

- Edit HTML in VS Code or GitHub’s web editor  
- Add notes to `pages/notes/`  
- Link new notes manually from `index.html`  
- Update `notes.xml` and `sitemap.xml` manually  
- Keep everything human-readable and intentionally quiet  

---

### Hosting

- Hosted via GitHub Pages  
- Custom domain defined in `CNAME`  
- No tracking, no analytics, no cookie warnings  
- No CMS, no CDN, no dependencies  
- Just HTML and CSS, on purpose  

---

### Metadata

Each page includes minimal metadata for basic SEO and link previews:

- `description`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, etc.  
- Atom-style feed at `/notes.xml`  
- `humans.txt` because it still matters  

---

### Accessibility

- Text-based and fully navigable without JavaScript  
- Responsive layout with semantic HTML  
- Theme toggle for dark/light preferences  
- Tested for keyboard navigation and screen reader basics  

---

### Local Preview (Optional)

You can preview the site locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.  
No server or build step required.
