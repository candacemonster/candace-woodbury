*Some days are spreadsheets. Some days are trail dust. Most days are a confusing mix of both.*

## where i am

Location:  
Weather:  
Energy level: somewhere between “functional adult” and “sentient houseplant.”

Quick snapshot. No drama, just context.

## what i’m working with

Today’s reality:

- Work:
- Health:
- Bandwidth: low / medium / “please don’t call me”
- Coffee: acceptable / excellent / barely doing its job

Honest, not heroic.

## what i noticed

A few things that stood out:

- [ ] something that went better than expected  
- [ ] something that was harder than it needed to be  
- [ ] something worth remembering later  

Not a gratitude list. More like evidence.

## trail, read, listen

**trail**  
Name:  
Where:  
Notes: conditions, views, dogs, anything to remember next time.

**reading**  
Title / author:  
Why it’s working (or not) right now.

**playlist**  
Apple Music playlist, album, or mix:  
What mood it carried.

## tiny adjustments

Not a plan. Just small course corrections:

- do more of:
- do less of:
- try tomorrow:

If it feels like too much, cut it in half.

## gear, tools, or comforts

What actually helped today:

- [ ] gear that made work or outside time easier  
- [ ] a tool/app that didn’t get in the way  
- [ ] a small comfort (tea, blanket, dog snoring nearby, etc.)

Practical, not aspirational.
