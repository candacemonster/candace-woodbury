<h2 id="where-i-am">where i am</h2>

<p>location: high point trail, red cliffs desert reserve, st. george, utah<br />
conditions: off cottonwood springs rd / old dump rd (black gulch trailhead)<br />
energy level: heavy. sore hearts.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-working-with">what i’m working with</h2>

<p>we’d checked out a few trails the morning of october 25th. nothing urgent, just wandering, letting the girls stretch their legs—meant to be a quick scope at the trailhead, you know, just see what’s what. maybe come back for a longer hike or bike ride when joints and attitudes felt up for it.</p>

<p>old age and spinal arthritis had other plans. slapped us in the face, hard and fast, a few days later. plans for “next time” evaporated. and suddenly we were left saying goodbye, forever, to our baby and trail partner tove.</p>

<p>desert light has felt a bit different after that.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-noticed">what i noticed</h2>

<p>highlights (aka distractions for sore hearts):</p>

<ul>
  <li>yellow flashes — desert marigold, probably, stubborn and loud</li>
  <li>long, dancing grasses — demanding photographic attention</li>
  <li>purple asters — little disco accents pushing through rosette leaves</li>
  <li>orange globemallow — easy to spot, easier to admire</li>
  <li>low, white desert spurge — sticking close to rocks, probably smarter than all of us</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terrain-notes">terrain notes</h2>

<p>sandy, rocky, flat-ish. not much elevation gain, but every bump counts when the pack gets older. dog approval ratings fine for our gals, except for the holes (existential and otherwise).</p>

<ul>
  <li>bring water. stay humble. desert trails don’t care about your backstory.</li>
  <li>if you’re here with old dogs, take extra photos.</li>
  <li>leave no trace but maybe a few quiet memories.</li>

<h2 id="where-i-am">where i am</h2>

<p>location: inside, mostly. actual trail: rare.<br />
conditions: dusk sneaking in earlier. grass gold, bikes colder.<br />
energy level: guilty. monitor-tanned.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-working-with">what i’m working with</h2>

<p>summer? i heard rumors. apparently it happened.</p>

<p>what did i do? worked. watched my bikes and paddle board wait, gathering dust—no love, just guilt. my computer got all my best hours.</p>

<p>the dogs and my husband: a few walks. a handful of sunsets. three bonfires, if i’m padding the stats.</p>

<p>most weeks it was “just one more thing” on the screen, instead of “just one more trail.”</p>

<h2 id="what-i-noticed">what i noticed</h2>

<ul>
  <li>not proud. not dramatic. just wishing i’d chosen laces over logins, sweat over spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>i’m not getting younger. these dogs, these mountains—deserve more than cameo appearances.</li>
  <li>at least we made it up to mackay, chasing sparks and dusk. could’ve been weekly. was barely a season.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trail-read-listen">trail, read, listen</h2>

<h2 id="where-i-am">where i am</h2>

<p>location: reservoir edge, parked with a water view and no real excuse.<br />
conditions: still. warm. strangers present but minding their business.<br />
energy level: stalled. that familiar static.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-working-with">what i’m working with</h2>

<ul>
  <li>board: inflated</li>
  <li>gear: packed</li>
  <li>water: calm</li>
  <li>day: open</li>
</ul>

<p>not scared. just stuck on the part where i walk past a few people, alone. then be out there, still alone. even if i like it.</p>

<p>if there were a dock, i’d already be gone.<br />
if someone said “let’s go,” i would’ve.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-noticed">what i noticed</h2>

<ul>
  <li>bought <a href="https://share-backcountry.onxmaps.com/exwods8oaVb">onx backcountry</a>. not for the trails (though it does those), but for property lines. water access. land boundaries.</li>
  <li>also: to track paddles. to feel like i’m collecting something useful—or at least map-shaped.</li>
</ul>

none today. stayed parked.</p>

<h2 id="where-i-am">where i am</h2>

<p>location: trail, post-hike debrief.<br />
conditions: hot enough to matter.<br />
energy level: satisfied. dogs tired. boots still on.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-working-with">what i’m working with</h2>

<p>the problem: hot pavement, sharp rocks, one dog who loses boots like it’s her job.</p>

<p>tried a lot of boots. most ended up in the trail dust within the first quarter mile.</p>

<h2 id="what-actually-worked">what actually worked</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.dogmocs.com/">Dog Mocs</a></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>stayed on (the bar is low, but still)</li>
  <li>decent grip</li>
  <li>not stiff</li>
  <li>held up on rocks and heat</li>
</ul>

<p>not perfect. nothing is. but these didn’t end up as expensive trail litter.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-noticed">what i noticed</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the strap system actually matters more than the boot itself</li>
  <li>sizing is accurate—measure twice</li>
  <li>they still looks at me like i’ve betrayed them when i put them on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tiny-adjustments">tiny adjustments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>do more of: just putting them on even when I get the look.</li>
  <li>do less of: buying boots based on cute colors.</li>
  <li>try next: maybe socks underneath for the drama queen paws.</li>
</ul>
